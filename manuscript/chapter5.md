# Chapter 5: Feedforward and Feedback

## Feedback vs. Feedforward
We've all heard of feedback, where you're able to understand what you did well and what you can improve. But another important part of freelancing is feedforward.

Feedforward is the process of getting that information as you're going through a process. So instead of waiting to the end of a project and saying, "Hey boss, how did I do?", you can be more proactive and set up a system to get informatoin as you're going through the project.

## Why You Need Feedforward and Feedback

Getting information in a feedforward process gives you the flexibility to quickly make changes to your working style, project, or expectations, so that you can give your client the best possible experience. That also means that you can feel much cmore assured that you're working on the right goals. 

Feedback helps you see what you did in entirety, pinpoint the things that you did really well and the things that you could work on next time. Feedback is a good overall grade of how you did and also a great way to make your clients feel special, because you're trying to make sure their experience was as good as possible.

Ultimately both of these things will help you make a lot more money because you will have refined your process, started learning how to better handle clients, and gotten more knowledge in project management, too. That makes you an invaluable resource to a business or client that needs help on larger projects... and larger projects mean more money.

## Asking the Right Questions
### Feedforward
As you're talking to your client about this, remember that you're trying to identify things that can be improved now so that the project goes more smoothly. So make sure that you get details so that you can implement the changes. Here are a few questions you can talk about with your client when you're discussing your project: 

1. Up to this point how are you feeling about the project?
2. What are some of the best experiences you've had so far?
3. What events do you wish had gone better?
4. Have any of your goals for the project changed since we started?

### Feedback
It's important to ask questions that you can actually use to improve your skill set or working habits. 

You're trying to find out what skillsets really stood out during this project, what the client wished could have been smoother, and if they have any direct advice that can help you in the future. Here are a few questions to start with: 

1. Overall, how did you feel about this project?
2. What do you think went really well?
3. If we did this again, what would you have changed?
4. Do you feel confident that we met your objectives for the project?


## How to Set Up the Feedfoward and Feedback Interviews

You can have feed forward interviews on regular check-in calls, just to gauge how everything is going and get an idea of any changes that may have happened in the project. Feedforward should be regular, but informal, unless there's something seriously wrong with the project which would require you to make a lot of changes. 

For the feedback session, you can do an informal feedback session on your wrap-up call, where you go over final questions or advice for your client. 

I also send a survey link in my final email to them, and let the client know that their feedback is the only way I'm able to make sure my business is doing well and making people happy. It has three questions and takes about 5 minutes total to complete.
