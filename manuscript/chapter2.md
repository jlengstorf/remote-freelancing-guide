# Chapter 2: Building Your Base

## Building Your Base
 
In order to start doing all this, you've got to build your base. That means getting to know people and creating example work that you can share with people to show that you actually _know_ what you're doing.

## Networking 

The value of networks CANNOT be overstated. Networking works, and if you want to get continual business you're going to have to participate. Sorry, but it's true. 

Now, I lived about 24 years of my life before I even realized that you could actively network, and that was one of the reasons people were passing me by at work. Don't be like 24 year old Marisa. Leverage the power of your network.


### Facebook groups & online communities

The first place to start if you want to work remotely is, obviously, the great Interwebs. Since you're about to make a life reaching out to unknown people in (possibly) unknown lands and new time zones, you're best bet is to start where everyone's hanging out. The virtual water cooler: Facebook.

So, you can find tons of Facebook groups related to the industry you're in and the people you're looking to help. All you have to do is a quick Facebook search to see all the different communities.

You can also join online communities or mastermind groups that cater specifically to your industry. Check out Reddit, LinkedIn, and Github for some of the biggest online groups outside of Facebook.

Now, once you're part of the group, this is where the real fun begins. Much like a networking event, you've got to actually talk to people in order to get any benefit.

Joining and talking in onine groups can be a little intimidating, so here are a few things that will give you a framework for your first posts.

1. Welcome and Conversation Post
"Hi, my name is Marisa Morby and I love [your very interesting job here]. I'm new to this group, and wanted to say a quick hello. As I was working the other day I realized [funny anecdote about a small work fail: spilling coffee on yourself, forgetting to follow up, etc.]. I immediately [thing you did to fix the problem]. I was wondering, how do y'all deal with [main work fail you're talking about]."

This post is meant to introduce yourself, get people to chuckle, and start a conversation. It first and foremost shows that you're human, have a sense of humor, and you're a person that likes to find solutions. I've used some variation of this post on every group I've ever joined, and it works every time.

2. An Ask and an Offer
"Hi there! So I've been working on [amazing thing you've been doing], and I've come up against [unforseen obstacles]. I know that you all have a lot more experience with this [area of expertise], and I would love to tap into that resource! So, here's my offer and ask:
	#OFFER [Thing you're willing to give someone for their time. This can be consulting, a service, a product, advice. Whatever you feel comfortable giving away for free.]"

	#ASK [Specicic thing you need that will help you reach your goal.]

This shows that you've got something to bring to the table, instead of just an empty plea for help. It's always okay to ask for help, but remember you've got something to give, too!

3. So I found this interesting thing...
"Hi, my name is Marisa and I work on [this amazing job doing fun things]. As I was looking into [specific industry thing], I stumbled on this article. (include the link) I thought that it was really fascinating because [X, Y, Z]. And it made me wonder, as [specific type of industry professional], how do you handle [question raised in the article]"

Again, this incites people to start a conversation. You're also helping people out without asking for anything else in return, which is a great way to introduce yourself.

### Conferences
Another great way to start networking is going to industry conferences. You can visit lanyrd.com to see different tech conferences happening around the world. And if you're not going into a technical field, you can simply google your industry and look for upcoming conferences. Chances are there's a group that looks for conferences in your industry.

The reason you go to conferences is about 30% to hear the speakers and 70% to _talk_ to the speakers, go out for drinks, and make new friends. So my one conference rule is this: say yes to all the things.

Someone wants to go out for drinks? Yes! Want to catch dinner tomorrow? Yes! I'm eating over here, want to meet this cool new cat I just met? Yes!

Conferences only last a couple days and it's really the perfect amount of time to make close connections without getting sick of people. 

### Twitter

Ah Twitter. The echochamber of the universe. True... but you can actually make some pretty sweet connections there if you've got the gumption to tweet at people publicly. It's also great for sharing your own thoughts, your articles, or article's of people that you find interesting. 

The easiest way to use Twitter, if you're someone like me who basically has nobody following me, is to connect with people you otherwise wouldn't be able to meet by following them. Retweet there articles a few times and they will eventually follow you. After that, you can start a conversation with them.

Last note on Twitter... do NOT, under ANY circumstances, use the automatic messaging when somebody follows you. As a business owner, I get it, you think, "Oh well, I want people to know who I am and thank them for following me." As an unfortunate victim of these "Thanks for following" messages, I can tell you that the second you do it, I instantly hate you. And often unfollow you. I don't know you. I don't know your mama. Why the hell are you messaging me out of nowhere with some stupid intro and a link to your book. Now I'm nevr going to buy _anything_ from you. Point is, it's a smarmy tactic. Don't be a creeper. Don't send automatic messages.

## Building Your Portfolio

Another staple in addition to networking is your portfolio. This is one place where people can go to look at your work. It's going to seem intimidating to set up, and you'll feel silly adding one little article to your portfolio. But you've got to start somewhere, and sending individual pieces to prospective clients is a real time suck. 

So, where can you go to build this beautiful portfolio? There are many sites, but I personally use Github, Behance, and Contently. Github stores all the sites I've created, Behance is for graphic design, UX/UI, illustration, copywriting, and product design. Basically any visual project can go on here. I use Contently to store all of the articles I've written, although you should also be saving a PDF of the article once it goes live in case the site it's on goes out of service. 

### I don't have any portfolio pieces, what do I do?

A common issue when you're just starting out is that you won't have any work to highlight. When I decided to freelance in copywriting at 28, after only working in HR the last five years, I had a whole lot of nothing to show for it. Sure, I'd learned a lot. I'd learned how to manage conflicts, create teams, interview, write â€” lots of stuff. But I didn't have anything that I could put in front of a potential client.

So first, decide what you want to focus on. Then create a side project for yourself. This can be anything from a UX/UI site redesign, to articles, blog posts, websites, illustrations, or photography.

Just make sure that it focuses on the skills you're trying to market or improve, and be sure to highlight your process. 

Clients aren't expecting to see that you did the same exact thing for another company. They just want you to convince them that you know what you're talking about. So be transparent with your process and explain why you designed the project the way you did.

### But I'm trying to make money here and you're talking about side projects!

Yes, you are. But you've got to have something to show clients, and get a handle on your own process. So, you can do a couple things. You can offer to do work for friends at a reduced one-time fee, you can offer your project for a non-profit at a reduced one-time fee, or you can complete a project that you know will get a lot of exposure. Exposure doesn't pay the bills, but if you'll get in front of 30,000 people by writing an article instead of just the 300 you can reach on your own site, then of course you're getting something great out of it.

I never work for free, and you shouldn't either. But free doesn't just mean money. It means doing something for nothing in return. If you're hitting your target market and getting in front of a lot of people, make sure to weigh the pros and cons before passing up the opportunity.

## Getting Noticed

Now you've done all this work building a portfolio and joining groups, surely people will flock to you, right? I mean, you're smart, creative, a hard worker. What's not to love?

Unfortunately, it absolutely, 100% DOES NOT work that way. You're not Kevin Costner. This isn't a "build it and they will come" type of situation.

You're going to have to put yourself out there and let people know that you exist. You've got a few ways that you can do this. 

### Personal site
A personal site is a simple way to show that you are, in fact, alive and that you can be contacted. It can be as simple as one page and cost you as little as $0 if you're on a site like Wordpress. This just needs to be a place where people can learn how you can help them and how to get in touch. Don't focus on this first. Focus on getting actual projects done and promoting them.

### Social Media
Social media is a great way to let people know what you're working on, what you've created, and the types of work that you're available to do.

Focus on posting where most of your potential clients are hanging out. If they're on Facebook, reach out to them there with articles, videos, and other helpful content. 

You don't need to post on all of the social media sites to see results. You _only_ need to be consistent and keep showing up on the channels where your audience is. 

### Guest Posting
Guest posting is a great way to get noticed, too. Now, this doesn't just apply to writing. You can do videos, interviews, appear on podcasts, have your work featured, all types of things. When I say guest posting, I mean putting something you created on someone else's site to get more views.

You can create a list of sites to guest post on by defining your audience a little bit. What are you interested in? Are there certain types of people you like working with? Where do they go when they need information on the type of service your offering?

If you need help defining your target audience, check out the resources section for some great articles written by people who are way better at breaking this subject down.

## Deciding your rate and who you're selling to
Before you start finding clients, you should also figure out what your rates are and your project parameters. 

To figure out your rates, I suggest going over to [the nuSchoo](http://thenuschool.com/how-much/?from=boldhome#/start) and filling out their questionnaire that helps you decide how much you should charge. Don't worry too much about project type. The important thing to focus on is your rate and time committment. 

But in addition to that, think about what type of project parameters you want to work on. Do you only want to work on shorter projects that have a quick turnaround â€” something like two weeks, so that you're always working on new things and meeting new clients? Or would you rather work on larger projects that last anywhere from a month to six months? Knowing this will help you decide whether or not a project is right for you.

You can find some more information about pricing and rates in the resources section.
