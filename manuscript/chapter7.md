# Chapter 7: Getting Referred for More Projects

## Why you need referrals
Right along with testimonials are referrals. As you're growing as a freelancer, referrals will be your biggest source for clients, and even once you've got a great client base, you'll probably find that most of the new clients you get found you through a friend of a friend who recommended you. 

So, referrals really are your holy grail of finding clients. The other bonus is that they often help you weed out real shitty people because they'll have already been vetted by your network. 

## How to ask for referrals
You'll probably find that the most difficult part of getting referrals is just asking for them. It took me a really long time to decide that even though I was afraid of asking people to give me referrals, that I needed to do it anyway.

One easy way to do ask for referrals is by email. Here's a template that I use for emails to previous clients or friends when I'm looking for referrals: 

>I wanted to send a quick note and let you know that I've got some spots open for client work â€” in case anyone in your network was in need of a copywriter or content writer. 
What I can offer right now is:
		- Site Copy Revamp 
		- Site Copy Creation
		- Copywriting for landing pages, sales pages, or email opt-ins
		- Email copy for automation sequences
		- Unique Blog Content
If you've got anybody you think I should get in touch with, just let me know, and I'll get on it!

You can also use this same basic template when you are meeting a friend for coffee, or having a phone call with a previous client.

## How to follow up with referrals
Once some leads start to funnel in, you just need to follow up with an email to set up an initial call, and then you're back to Chapter 4, where we talked about interviewing potential clients.

So, the follow up email you can send should look something like this: 

> I hope you're doing well. [NAME] mentioned that you were looking for a writer. I'd be happy to learn more about the project. Do you have 15 minutes to jump on a short call to discuss more details?

> I can be reached by phone at [NUMBER] or on Skype at [ID]. I'm available at [TIME AND DATE] of this week. Just let me know if any of these times work for you. 

> Thanks!
