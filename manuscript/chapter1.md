# Chapter 1: The challenges and benefits of working remotely

## What remote work is
  Now, almost everywhere you read about remote work, somebody is saying how amazing it is. How it opens all these doors and doesn't limit you geographically. I am, in fact, one of those people. I love the remote work and the way that it allows people from all over the world to work together on projects that can change the world.

  But what exactly is remote work? For this book, I'm going to say that remote work is any work that you can do without going into an office building. That means you can work from home, a coffee shop, a coworking space... wherever. So, this definition covers all types of work and is meant to help you find clients that aren't located where you're located.

## Challenges of working remotely
  Now, although I have lots of pretty great things to say about remote work, and will cite increased productivity studies, and employee morale to back up my point, I of course know that remote working isn't some magical unicorn solution that fixes all of our working frustrations. 

  In fact, it can breed it's own host of confusion and frustration, and I think you should know what that is before throwing yourself face first into the remote work hype. 

  So what are the challenges?
  
### Rarely find your clients in person
  
  So, like I mentioned previously, this book is about finding clients that aren't located in the same area as you. This can add an extra layer of complexity to an already often frustrating process. 

### Don't have an in person network

  In addition to this, you'll eventually grow a network of people from all over the world. But it won't be the same as having a close group of coworkers that you see at work every day. Especially if you're freelancing, because starting out you'll be a team of one, Yoko Solo, Solomente Uno. You get my point. It can get a little lonely if you don't reach out to others.

### Don't have in person meetings

  Since you won't be able to just walk over to your client's desk this will make meetings a little different. All my meetings are video chats or phone calls, which I certainly don't mind. It's just very different than what most of us are used to.

### All conflicts resolved over email or video call
  
  Eventually there will be misunderstandings, miscommunications, and disagreements. You won't be able to take your client out for coffee and dig into the issue. Instead, you'll need to craft a kind email to set up a time for a video call. This can mean that conflicts feel dragged out if you're not on top of your game.

## Benefits of working remotely

But of course, I would argue that all of these negative factors are extremely outweighed by the benefit of working remotely. Ever since I started working this way, I don't know if I can ever go back to working in an office. 

### Freedom to live anywhere where you want

The first benefit is of course the freedom to live wherever you want. If you love a city but you know the job market isn't great, remote freelancing means that as long as you've got an internet connection you're set. 

### Travel on your own schedule

You also get the option of traveling when and however you want. Want to book a plane ticket for Tuesday at 2:00pm? No problem. You can follow up on emails from the airport and be back to work the next morning. 

### Work on your own schedule

One of the biggest positives for me was getting to work on my own schedule. If I'm feeling particularly creative at 1 am, I can get some copywriting done. If I'm bored on a rainy Saturday I can knock out some user flows. It forces me to be accountable for my time, which in turn, has made me respect it much more.
