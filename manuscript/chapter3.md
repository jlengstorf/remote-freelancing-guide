# Chapter 3: Finding Your First Client

## Finding Your First Client
Finding your first client feels a little bit like magic. You know people have done it, but you don't really get how. I spent a lot of time reading articles and asking people, how do you do it? How do you get the first client? It makes no sense!

### Referrals
Your best bet, almost always, will be a referral. Your friends might not need your service, but they surely must know one person that does. And that's all you need â€” one. 

So, don't be shy. Email and call friends, family, previous co-workers, friends from events, your childhood friend's sister's best friend (true story). My point is, it's easier to start with people who already know you, or know of you.

I resisted doing this for a long time because it felt really uncomfortable. I felt like I was either begging or being smarmy asking my friends to talk to their friends for me.

But people are always happy to help. Think about it. If the situation was flipped, you'd be more than happy to give them a couple names of people you knew.

You can make this easy by telling your friends, "Hey, I'm doing [service you're offering], which [how it helps people]. If you know anyone who needs help with this, feel free to send them my way!" 

Mention it when you meet for coffee, send old friends a message or text, be sure to talk about it when you call your family. It doesn't have to be a big deal, just a reminder that you're ready and available. 

You want to stay top of mind so that when your friend's fried says, "I'm having a lot of trouble with the ads I'm writing for my art shop," your friend can immediately say, "Hey, my friend writes ads and website copy. She might be able to help you. You want her number?" 

### Online Groups
We talked a little earlier about how to get started in online groups, introduce yourself, and start participating. Once you've made this a habit, you can leverage these online relationships into client work.

You've probably already asked questions in the group, and also offered your insight on certain issues. So how can you take this even further?

The best way to do this is to give information and solutions freely. Now, your immediate reaction might be, "But if I do that, no one will ever hire me. They'll just take my ideas and find someone else or do it themselves." That's unlikely for a host of reasons.

One, by giving away free helpful information, you've called upon the social norm of reciprocity. That means that we feel a deep social obligation to give something in return. For example, when a friend buys you a coffee, next time you go out, you'll buy. You've got to keep the give and take balance of the relationship. 

Secondly, by telling people how to solve their problem, you show that you're an expert. You've already shown that you can think through this issue, and have created a solution. Now, they can take that information and use it themselves, or hire someone else, but it's pretty unrealistic that this will happen since you clearly know what you're doing. Think of it this way, if you ask someone how to create a blog, and they tell you the process, you can see that of course you _could_ do it, but chances are you'll just hire that person to do it for you. 

### Guest Posting
Guest posting also offers a great opportunity to find clients. It does two things for you. It serves as social proof that you know what you're doing, because a third party has looked at your work and said, "Oh, this person actually know what they're talking about." In addition, it's like a piece that can be used to show how you think, your creativity, and how you put things together.

To get the most out of guest posting, you really need to interact with the people who are seeing your work. That means sharing what you've written on social media, replying to comments, and asking thought provoking questions that get conversations started.

With guest posting, people will often see your work and come to you after seeing what you've done, hoping that you can do something similar for them. For example, I've gotten clients because they read through my articles on another site, really liked my voice, and wanted me to bring that creativity to their own brands. I didn't seek them out, they just liked what they saw, knew that I wrote for a living, and emailed me.

So make sure that you seek out projects on sites that you enjoy visiting, have a really interactive community, a large audience, or that you use yourself as a resource. This makes it much easier to create posts or projects because you're naturally drawn to the information on the site.

### Warm Pitches... not cold pitches
Lastly, you can use warm pitches to find clients. Now, I personally would only do this if there's a company or product that really stand out to you and you're _dying_ to work for them. 

I say that because these types of pitches require a lot of upfront work on your part if you want them to work out. 

Two years ago, I would've said, "Just send a cold pitch and leave it." But now I know better. A cold pitch is often a dead pitch.

A warm pitch still has some life left in it.

You can create this type of pitch with some investigative work, creativity, and guts. 

To create a pitch like this, you'll need to do research on:

1. Who is the person that will see the pitch and make the decision to call you? Get to know their name, their work history, and a little bit about them. This goes a long way in personalizing your pitch so you don't sound like a crazy stalker robot.

2. You obviously really like this company or product, but what current problems are they facing? How can you solve that problem? Then, show them. Remember that whole, "give information freely" part? This is a great place to do that. 

3. Create a document or site that highlights all of this information, and then send it to the person who has the power to call you and set up a meeting. Be persistent and conscientious. But most of all, be yourself. Don't strip out your personality to try and sound smart or perfect. Leave the human in the email you send.
