# Chapter 6: Getting Testimonials

## Why You Need Testimonials
In addition to getting feedback, you should also ask for testimonials. This is just a short quote from your client, that describes how it was to work with you.

Testimonials serve as the social proof that helps people make the decision to buy something, and we all succumb to this on some level.

Think of it this way... if you have a leak in your bathroom, you know you need a plumber. Are you going to search "Plumber near me" on Google? Probably not. You'll probably hop on Facebook or text your parents to ask if they could recommend a plumber that they trust. 

Testimonials serve to create trust for people that are making a decision to contact you.

## How to Ask for Testimonials
I include a text section in my feedback survey so that people can write whatever they like. Then at the end of the survey I include a question that says, "Can I use your comments in this survey for a testimonial?" and they're able to indicate yes or no.

If you need a testimonial from someone you've already worked with, you can send a short email to them letting them know what purpose the testimonial serves and then even help them out by drafting a short, example testimonial that they can use as a guide.

Many times, clients will approve the testimonial that you've written, because it's true and also saves them the time of writing it themselves.

## Getting a good Testimonial
To get a good testimonial, ask questions that focus on how you helped the client reach their project goals, and how the two of you worked together. The more personable the testimonial, the better.

## How to Use Testimonials
Testimonials work great on your website, as proof that you are an actual human, have skills, and are likeable. I always suggest putting a couple on your homepage so that it's more inviting.

You can post (with permission) a nice comment that someone emailed you, and thank them publicly. That gives kudos to you and the person you've worked with.

You can also have people give you testimonials directly through LinkedIn, so that if clients are looking you up through that portal, they're still able to see that you've got clients that trust you.
