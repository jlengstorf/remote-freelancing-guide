# Chapter 4: Working With Your First Client

## Working With Your First Client
Alright, so you've talked to people, told everyone you know that you're available for work, and someone contacted you for more information. Hooray... and also... shit! Now what?

Well, first you've got to interview each other to see if you'll work well together.

## Holding the Initial Interview
I usually do the initial interview over a video call, since I'm not going to meet this person face to face. Video helps me get to know them a little bit better and makes me more on top of my game since I can actually see their face, reactions, etc.

So, you're trying to find out three main things with this first interview:

1. Can I actually help them?

2. Is this person cool or crazy?

3. Is this something I want to work on?

### Can I actually help them?
To figure out whether or not you can help them, you'll need to know more about their current problem and the goals they're trying to accomplish. Your list of questions will change a bit depending on the type of project you're working on, but in general you'll want to know:

> What's the current issue you're facing and what solution would you like to see?
> What are the top three goals you're trying to achieve with these changes?
> How will you measure success for this project?

You don't need to have all the answers, and I work on a 90/10 rule. Meaning, if I know that I can help them with 90% of what they're asking for, even if I don't fully understand 10% of what they need, it's small enough that I can figure it out and grow. 

### Is this person cool or crazy?
Now, this one will take some trial and error, because you'll need to be pretty perceptive and work through the answers they give you to see if there are any red flags.
The questions you want to ask for this all include past behavior with freelancers and projects. So, start with:

> Have you ever worked with a freelancer before? What was your experience?
> How do you best communicate with your freelancers, clients, or customers? 
> Can you tell me a little bit about a bad relationship you had with a client or customer and tell me why. And what was the best relationship you've had? 
> What's the biggest challenge you'll face in accomplishing the goal you're going for? (lack of time, access to decision makers, etc.) 

A good way to decide whether or not this person is someone you'll want to work with, is to think about how you feel after the conversation. Are you excited, and happy to get started? Or do you feel drained and anxious? These immediate reactions tend to be right most of the time, so be sure to take them into account.

### Is this something I want to work on?
After you've got that information, ask questions that will help you figure out whether or not it's something you actually want to work on. Is it an industry you're interested in? Will working with them let you use a new tool that you've been wanting to try? These are mostly questions to ask yourself after the interview. 

When you're just starting out, I would suggest taking the project so that you can learn what type of projects you enjoy working in and and you'll be able to decide as you go whether or not you enjoy certain industries.

### Other things to watch out for
Even if you think they might be great to work with and you're excited about the project, there are still some things to watch out for:

1. They're hard to follow up with or get in touch with.

2. They constantly reschedule or forget about meetings.

3. They take a long time responding to your proposal, signing your contract, or paying your deposit.

I have a strict one follow up rule when working with people. If I send over an email with information on next steps, and I don't hear anyting back, I'll wait 4 or so days, send another email as a reminder. After that, I don't follow up again. In my experience, if you've got to push that hard to get started, you'll regret it mid-project when the person doesn't respond... or worse, doesn't pay you.

## Creating a Proposal

Okay, so you've vetted a client and you're going to send them a proposal. The proposal lays out their options for work, and your prices. It's basically a document that houses your conversation, what their needs and goals are, how you're going to help them achieve it, and how you're going to do that.

I tend to break my proposals up into a few parts.

Part 1. Intro and summary of what we talked about on the phone.
Part 2. Breakdown of the things I can help them with. How I'll do it, and how it will benefit them.
Part 3. Project packages that I'm willing to offer. Again, here's a fun little bit of psychology: I always offer three packages: Basic, Complete, and Deluxe (you can name it whatever you want). 

The first package is the bare bones of what we talked about. Exactly what they asked for and nothing more. The second package includes all of the things we talked about plus something extra that will add value to the first package. The third option is everything in option two, but with something of massive added value that we didn't necessarily talk about but will help them blow their goal out of the water. 

Most clients will choose the middle option, because they get more than the basics, but be able to turn down an option they feel is too expensive.

To put it another way, let's say you need a place to sit so you're going to buy a chair. Option 1 would be a simple wooden chair, perfect for sitting, but no frills. It works just the way it's supposed to. Option 2 would be the same chair with a seat and back cushion so that it's super comfy, and looks nice and inviting. Option 3 would be the chair, the cushions, and a padded foot rest so you can put your feet up, too. Do you need it to be able to sit? No. Does it make your experience _way_ better? Yes!

I included a link to a template proposal in the resources section of the book, so you can see what I mean.

After you've sent the proposal, try and get on a call so that you can discuss any questions that they have. That way, you can avoid confusion later, and reassure them of how great this project will be. 

## Creating a Contract
The last step is to send the contract. Even small projects should have one, just to make sure that everyone is protected. It helps list everything that you're responsible for on this project, vs. what the client is responsible for. In addition, it relieves you of liability in case something should go wrong.

Writing a contract can be tough, and you should always get it checked by a lawyer to make sure that it's valid and protects your interests.

I've included a link to a sample contract (similar to what I use) in the resources section of the book.

It can feel uncomfortable asking a client to sign a contract, because it's very formal. Some people also worry that it undermines the trust aspect of the relationship, because it's implies that you don't believe they'll hold up their end of the deal.

But, it's really just a document that lays out project and payment details, and protects both parties. When you send over the contract, make sure to emphasize that's all it's for. Business transactions require business paperwork, plain and simple.

## Avoiding Miscommunications
Nobody wants to deal wtih logn emails or uncomfortable phone conversations with constant apologizing and making amends. Instead, it's much easier to avoid miscommunications as much as possible. 

Now, when you're working with clients, this is a bit different because you're the one responsible for getting _all_ the necessary information in order to complete your portion of the project. Which sort of makes you a project manager by default. 

So to avoid misunderstandings, there are a few things you can do to avoid misunderstandings in the first place.

Start by asking clarifying questions in all of your emails and phone conversations. Freelance requires you to ask the right questions upfront so that you can better see the trajectory of the project.

Make sure that you are emailing your client frequently and letting them know how you're progressing on the project, even if you don't have anything to send over just yet. It's best if you email them first so they never have to send you something saying, "So, I hadn't heard from you yet so I was wondering..." There is nothing worse than radio silence after you've given someone money and are waiting for them to deliver a project. It makes people tense. So emailing every couple of days will help to relieve your client's stress while keeping you sane.

Make sure that you set good boundaries with your client as well. Don't respond on weekends. Don't respond after hours. If you're going on a trip let them know beforehand and put up your away message if a email comes in. If you don't do this it becomes very easy to end up working on a Sunday because you responded to an email. Not because your client is disrespectful, but because you basically told them, "Yes, I work on weekends," by responding to an email _on_ the weekend. So only answer emails when you're actually at work.

## Handling Miscommunications
Projects sometimes suffer from miscommunications and misunderstandings. This can happen because you didn't clarify enough, the client isn't quite sure what they need, or — more often than not — you didn't know what you didn't know, and failed to ask the right questions. 

So, if a conflict has come up between you and your client, you may feel uncomfortable and want to avoid the situation. But you've got to be as proactive as you can.

That starts with a phone call to clarify and discuss what happened. It's easy to blame the client for not telling you everything, or making your life harder, but remember that you're both on the same team, trying to accomplish a shared goal. Getting pissed won't fix the problem, so focus only on solutions and moving forward.

That sounds so simple, but trust me, in a freelance/client, situation it's easy to get blindsided with frustration because you're not communicating well.
